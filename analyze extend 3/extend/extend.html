<!--
	To enhance the HTML document's structure and semantics, all <div> components were replaced in step 3 with HTML5 semantic elements. The material enclosed by semantic elements (<header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>, etc.) has a clearer meaning, which facilitates understanding and navigation of the webpage's structure by search engines, accessibility tools, and developers. This makes the code easier to read, more accessible, and easier to maintain overall.
