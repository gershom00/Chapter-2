<!--
	The uneven color coding that I saw when I first opened the file suggested that there might be syntax mistakes or problems with the HTML markup. This discrepancy may indicate invalid attribute values, missing or wrongly closed elements, or other structural issues with the code.

I repeatedly ran the file through the HTML validator in order to identify and fix any issues. Every time, I looked over the validator's error messages, found the mistakes in the code, fixed them, and then revalidated the file. The iterative procedure persisted until all problems were fixed and the HTML markup complied with the validator's requirements.
